# Number-Identification-AI
Inspired and guided by 3b1b's video on how backpropagation machine learning works. All code, however, is original and my own. Able to acheive 93% testing accuracy with layer sizes of 784,16,16,10; batchsize of 32, learning rate of 0.1, and 10 epochs. Now, I wrote this several months ago and don't remember exactly how long it took to train but definetly something I ran overnight. My code is very inefficient as the main goal of the project was developing my understanding of how basic machine learning works, not making the best code possible :P

Feel free to use my code however you want (MIT License) but I cannot think of a reason why anyone would want to use it... it's that bad.
